In my \"Inventory Optimization Project\" at Global Retail Solutions, I leveraged SQL queries to address a complex data challenge related to optimizing inventory levels. The goal was to reduce excess stock while ensuring customer satisfaction levels were maintained.\n\nI began by analyzing historical sales data and inventory records using SQL queries to identify patterns and trends in product demand. By querying the database to calculate reorder points based on sales velocity and lead time, I was able to determine optimal inventory levels for each product category.\n\nThrough the visualization of these insights in Tableau, stakeholders could easily understand the inventory optimization recommendations. As a result of implementing these data-driven strategies, we successfully reduced excess stock by 25% without compromising customer satisfaction. Additionally, our demand forecasting accuracy improved by 15%, leading to better inventory management decisions and cost savings for the company.\n\nThis project highlighted the power of utilizing SQL queries to extract valuable insights from data, which ultimately influenced decisions related to inventory planning and optimization, contributing to improved operational efficiency and profitability.", "evaluation": {"analytical_score": 3, "technical_score": 3, "business_score": 4, "communication_score": 4, "overall_score": 8, "reused_project": false, "penalty_reason": "", "feedback": "The candidate demonstrated strong business acumen and clear communication skills in explaining the project's impact.
